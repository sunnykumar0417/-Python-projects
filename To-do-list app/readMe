I made this app using python where i created 5 functions as follows
1st add function 
  in this funntion user can add thier task by multiple times
  to create this i used while loop to take input as many times as user want and also save each time
2nd save function:
  in this function i wrote code to save all tasks in local device
3rd overwrite function:
  it is similar to save funtion but in save func i can append data and in overwrite i just rewrite the data to mark as completed
4th mark function :
 It allows to mark the task as completed 
5th load function :
 it adds all data from the txt file to list where use can iterate or select any data to make it as marked or delete
6th delete function :
  It just deletes any task from the file
